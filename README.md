# SRE by day, Hacker by night. It's kind of my super power!
[Script kiddie with ethics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pavocracy/Pavocracy/main/The%20Hacker's%20Ethics.md), [Spend too much time playing Minecraft](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pavocracy/Pavocracy/main/skyfactory_farm.png), [Web3 hopist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pavocracy/Pavocracy/main/A%20Cypherpunk's%20Manifesto.md), [Constantly navigating societies trade-offs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pavocracy/Pavocracy/main/my%20political%20compass.jpeg).

But fundamentally, I enjoy solving problems. My whole existence has been spent asking "How?".
Admittedly I rarely care about the "Why?". Motives aren't important, I want to figure out the mechanism of how something works (or doesn't!)

I strive to have a deep understanding of our technology, so that I may break down or build up anything I want!
Of particular interest to me is Cyber Security and Digital Privacy. Our complex digital society has created some really hard problems for us to solve in this space.

When I am not busy fixing Cloud Infrastructure or worrying about Service Availability, I try to dedicate a part of my identity to this cause through [Roxxum](https://github.com/Roxxum).
