# SRE by day, Hacker by night. It's kind of my super power!
Stereotypical script kiddie, Spend too much time playing Minecraft, Web3 hopist.

But fundamentally, I enjoy solving problems. My whole existence has been spent asking "How?".
Admittedly I rarely care about the "Why?". Often I struggle with how different others motives or values are from my own.
Figuring out the mechanism of how something works (or doesn't!) is far more interesting to me anyway! 

I strive to be able to have an understanding of our technology that allows me to completely break down, or build up, anything I want!
Of particular interest to me, is Cyber Security and Digital Privacy. Our complex digital society has created some really hard problems for us to solve in this space.
When I am not busy fixing Cloud Infrastructure or worrying about Service Availability, I try to dedicate a part of my identity to this cause through [Roxxum](https://github.com/Roxxum).
